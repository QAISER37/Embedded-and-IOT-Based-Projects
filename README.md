# üõ†Ô∏è Embedded and IoT Based Projects

This repository contains a collection of **hands-on embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT)** projects using platforms like **ESP32**, **Arduino**, **Bluetooth**, **ESP-NOW**, and more. Each project has its own folder with source code, circuit diagrams, and documentation where applicable.

## üìÅ Projects Included

| Project Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| [`Touch-Sensor-Sleep-Wake-ESP32`](./Touch-Sensor-Sleep-Wake-ESP32) | Uses ESP32 capacitive touch and MPR121 to implement a touch-activated deep sleep/wake system. |
| [`Classical_blu_with_MIT_APP`](./Classical_blu_with_MIT_APP/Motor_with_blu) | Controls a DC motor using Bluetooth (via MIT App Inventor). |
| [`overload_DC_motor_alert_system`](./overload_DC_motor_alert_system) | Monitors motor current using WCS1700 sensor and alerts using a buzzer on overload. |
| [`PWM_controlled_DC_motor`](./PWM_controlled_DC_motor) | Adjusts DC motor speed using PWM signal via a potentiometer. |
| [`master_Slave`](./master_Slave) | Demonstrates ESP-NOW communication between a master and a slave ESP32 device. |
| [`Master_slave_communication_using_HM-10`](./Master_slave_communication_using_HM-10) | Advanced multi-device control: master ESP32 receives Bluetooth commands (via HM-10) and controls multiple slaves over ESP-NOW. |
